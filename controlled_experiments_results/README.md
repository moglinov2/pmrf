# üìä Controlled Experiments ‚Äì Restored-image Results

This directory contains the outputs of the four controlled restoration tasks  
(colorization, denoising, inpainting, super-resolution) for various numbers of flow steps \(K\).  


---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top-level: `num_flow_steps_{K}`

Each folder corresponds to the total number of rectified-flow inference steps $K\in\{5,10,20,100\}$ used by all methods in that run.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Per-degradation subfolders

Inside each `num_flow_steps_{K}` you‚Äôll find one folder per degradation type:

| Folder Name                          | Task             | Degradation Description                                      |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `colorization_gaussian_noise_025/`   | Colorization     | Grayscale input + Gaussian noise (std=0.25)                  |
| `gaussian_noise_035/`                | Denoising        | Color input + Gaussian noise (std=0.35)                     |
| `random_inpainting_gaussian_noise_01/` | Inpainting     | 90% pixels masked + Gaussian noise (std=0.10)                |
| `sr_bicubic_x8_gaussian_noise_005/`  | Super-resolution | Downsampled √ó8 (bicubic) + Gaussian noise (std=0.05)         |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Method-specific outputs

Within *each* degradation folder you‚Äôll find five method subfolders:

| Folder Name                      | Method                                       |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `mmse/`                          | Posterior mean (Stage-1 predictor; low-distortion) |
| `naive_flow/`                    | ‚ÄúFlow from Y‚Äù (na√Øve posterior sampling)     |
| `pmrf/`                          | PMRF output $\hat X_0$                     |
| `posterior_conditioned_on_mmse/` | Flow conditioned on $\hat X^{\*}$ (X\* = MMSE) |
| `posterior_conditioned_on_y/`    | Flow conditioned on $Y$ (degraded input)   |

Each of these contains a directory of PNG files named exactly as the input IDs (so you can align them with your degraded and ground-truth images).
